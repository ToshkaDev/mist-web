    h4 Introduction
    p The MiST database was born in 2010 as to both predict and document bacterial signal transduction and provide a convenient portal for scientists to explore this knowledge. Unfortunately, this past year, the hardware powering MiST2 borked and our only backup unintentionally deleted.
    p We have completely rewritten the MiST database from the ground up. The backend pipeline and database is virtually complete and accessible via its REST API, which powers this website. The frontend still has much work to be done. Please be patient as we continue its development.
