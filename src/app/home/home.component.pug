    h4 Complete signal transduction profile
    p MiST 3.0 provides signal transduction profiles of more than 125,000 bacterial and archaeal genomes. This release of the database is a result of a substantial scaling to accommodate constantly growing microbial genomic data. 
    p The database can be explored using the web-interface or a&nbsp;
      a(href="https://api.mistdb.caltech.edu/") REST API
      | , which both powers this website and provides programmatic access to the underlying data.
    p The first version of MiST database was issued in 2007 to identify and document signal transduction systems in microbes and provide a convenient portal for scientists to explore this knowledge.
    p Although MiST3 is primarily focused on signal transduction, it stores precomputed features of all proteins encoded in NCBI RefSeq genomes. All NCBI RefSeq genomes and the encoded proteins can be explored using convenient features implemented in MiST without running external software.

    h4 Signal transduction systems classification
    p  MiST 3.0 provides a comprehensive classification of signal transduction systems and distribution of signal transduction proteins across OCS, TCS and chemosensory systems. The chemosensory systems table shows the chemosensory pathways encoded in the given genome.
