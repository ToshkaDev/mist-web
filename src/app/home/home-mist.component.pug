      p On the Genomes portal you can explore complete signal transduction profiles of all bacterial and archaeal genomes deposited to NCBI RefSeq database. To search for an organism just start typing its name, genome identifier or taxonomy information. To search for a gene/protein start typing its RefSeq identifier, locus tag or MiST stable identifier.  


      //These genome have been processed by the MiST multi-step pipeline, which includes the following steps: (i) identification of domains of all the proteins encoded in the genomes using the Pfam profile Hidden Markov models and MiST's own models, (ii) identification of transmembrane regions, (iii) identification and classification of signal transduction proteins, (iv) analysis of gene neighborhoods, (v) identification of low-complexity regions and coiled-coils, (vi) taxonomy assignment, and (vii) identification of the isolation source - biosample information. The microbial signal transduction (MiST) database was established as a comprehensive signal transduction classification system and has served as a useful community resource since 2007.
